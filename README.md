Schem - Multipurpose app
purpose not defined.

Powered by [pen](https://github.com/Monochromefx/pen)

## Schem has no real purpose yet it may in the future like an editor but right now it's just for testing.

Schem is just an app built to test to see what it may become. It really just depends.

The app is powered by [pen](https://github.com/Monochromefx/pen) which is my own little project.

And may also be powered by [Meso](https://github.com/Monochromefx/Meso) which is another project.
That is an editor made in javascript meant for online and offline uses.

but both this project and Meso are powered by pen so eh.
